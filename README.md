Another Excel builder for F#. Create Cell structures using easy commands. It doesn't implement every excel capability, just only those I required to use as today.

Still playing with Github Actions and this framework. I'm going to update it step by step. I'm trying to learn how to manage an open source project without burning myself, so please, be patient (if you can) or use another more professional framework that exist out there.
